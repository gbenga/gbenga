# Welcome 🤝🏾

I'm Gbenga, a Software Engineer currently based in London. I'm currently open to Software Engineering opportunities (open to relocation).

To find out more about my journey into Software Engineering, you can read my series on Medium: [Am I a Software Engineer yet?](https://medium.com/series/am-i-software-engineer-yet-5c6a51aa9833). I've covered topics such as, why *anonymous functions* are useful, *syntactic sugar* and dealing with *asynchronous operations*. 
I also write on dev.to, where I have discussed *Netflix's method for personalising your experience, and approaching UX design from a Software Engineer's perspective.* You can read my posts [here](https://dev.to/gbenga)!
