To find out more about my journey into Software Engineering, you can read my series on Medium: [Am I a Software Engineer yet?](https://medium.com/series/am-i-software-engineer-yet-5c6a51aa9833). I've covered topics such as, why *anonymous functions* are useful, *syntactic sugar* and dealing with *asynchronous operations*.
